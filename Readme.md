# Custom redirect page

This is a super simple script to host your own redirection page directly on Github Pages.
Think of it like your own version of `bit.ly` without the fancy add-ons.

## Why?

Because I want to keep track of the links I post online and I don't want `bit.ly` or the likes owning my links and stats.
With this script everything goes directly posted to Google Analytics.
